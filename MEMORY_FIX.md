# üöÄ Memory Optimization Fix for Render Deployment

## Problem
The application was running out of memory on Render's free tier (512MB limit), causing crashes with the error:
```
==> Out of memory (used over 512Mi)
```

## Root Causes
1. **Loading ALL emails into memory** before processing
2. **No limit on number of leads** stored in memory
3. **No garbage collection** optimization
4. **Processing all historical emails** instead of just recent ones

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Email Service Optimization (`backend/services/emailService.js`)
- **Stream processing**: Process emails one-by-one instead of loading all into memory
- **Date filtering**: Only fetch emails from last 30 days using IMAP `since` parameter
- **Size limit**: Added 20MB per email limit
- **Immediate cleanup**: Clear email data from memory after processing
- **Garbage collection hints**: Trigger GC every 10 emails

### 2. ‚úÖ Email Poller Memory Limits (`backend/utils/emailPoller.js`)
- **Max leads limit**: Set to 10,000 leads maximum in memory
- **Memory safety checks**: Prevent adding more leads if limit is reached
- **Explicit cleanup**: Clear processed arrays to free memory
- **Garbage collection**: Trigger GC after processing

### 3. ‚úÖ Node.js Memory Flags (`backend/package.json`)
```json
"start": "node --max-old-space-size=460 --expose-gc server.js"
```
- `--max-old-space-size=460`: Limit heap to 460MB (safe buffer under 512MB)
- `--expose-gc`: Enable manual garbage collection

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Memory usage stays under 460MB
- ‚úÖ No more "Out of memory" crashes
- ‚úÖ Faster email processing
- ‚úÖ Only recent emails are scanned (last 30 days)
- ‚úÖ Maximum 10,000 leads in memory at once

## How to Deploy
1. Commit and push these changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Memory optimization for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. Render will automatically redeploy with the new changes

## Monitoring
Check Render logs for:
- `üìß Scanned X emails from sender (last 30 days)` - Should be much lower now
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Memory limit reached!` - If you see this, the 10K limit is working
- No more "Out of memory" errors

## Trade-offs
- **10,000 lead limit**: If you get more than 10K leads per day, older ones won't be stored
- **30-day window**: Only emails from last 30 days are scanned
- Both limits can be adjusted if you upgrade to a paid Render plan with more memory

## Future Improvements
If you need more than 10K leads:
1. Upgrade to Render's Starter plan (512MB ‚Üí 2GB memory)
2. Use pagination more aggressively
3. Store leads in MongoDB instead of memory (requires schema changes)
